A blockchain is a list of records (blocks) upon which data transactions are stored in
a secured,tamper-proof, unalterable and transparent manner. Blockchain’s unique characteristics solves many business issues in our world today.
Below are some benefits of utilization a blockchain technology in your business or
projects:

i) Enhanced security: Transactions must be agreed upon before they are recorded on
the decentralized ledger. Right after a transaction is approved, it’s automatically
encrypted and linked to the previous transaction. Also, the fact that information is
stored across a network of computers other then a single server, makes it very
difficult and impossible for a hacker to compromise the transaction data.

ii) Improved transparency: Transaction histories are becoming more transparent
through the use of Blockchain technology. Since it is a distributed ledger, all network
participants share the same documentation as opposed to individual copies.

iii) Increased performance and speed: Unlike our centralized traditional entities that
utilize paper-heavy process which consumes a significant amount of time and are
prone to human error. By streamlining and automating these processes with
blockchain,transactions are lighting fast and efficient.

## <span id="Where_do_the_new_BUIDL_tokens_come_from"> Where do the new BUIDL token come from?</span>

Remember Build-it is built on top of [Hive Blockchain](), as such new tokens are
created every time a block is produced. Interestingly, Build-it allocates a majority of
the new tokens to a reward fund called “rewards pool” upon which users will be
rewarded for contributing value to the network.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_Reward_Pool">What is the Reward Pool?</span>

Every 24hours a fixed amount of BUIDL tokens are allocated to the network reward
fund,commonly called the “rewards pool” as stated earlier. These tokens are then
fairly distributed to the authors and curators for adding value to the network.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_I_get_more_BUIDL_tokens">How do I get more BUIDL tokens?</span>

The BUIDL is a robust token that powers the Build-it network - it’s the currency that
operates on the network. They can be bought of the market, mined through upvotes
and cu-ration rewards pay for products and services, and many more.

## <span id="So_I_earn_digital_tokens_on_my_blog_how_is_that_even_possible">So I earn digital tokens on my blog, how is that even possible?</span>

community members will share love by ‘upvoting’ your posts. The upvotes come in
BUIDL token,depending on the upvotes you receive, you may get a portion of the “rewards pool”

is known as voting. If you discover a newly published post and vote on it before
others do,you earn a curation reward for that said content. Remember, the higher
your BUIDL POWER, the more curation reward you earn.

## <span id="What_do_I_do_with_the_tokens">What do I do with the tokens?</span>
Below are some pretty basic usecases for the $buidl token:

* Low-cost transactions - one of the most popular usecase for most tokens is for
sending and receiving payments for products and services at an increasingly low fee
and 3sec transaction speed.
* Proof of censorship-resistant store of value - While our local bank keeps freezing
and blocking our bank assets accounts, truth be told - this act occurs more often
than people realize most. Holding the $buidl token gives each holder a
censorship-resistant alternative store of wealth as long as they have their private
keys saved in a third-party trusted platform.
* Being the first early investors of the start-up - Without a doubt, the emergence of
digital assets is giving everyone with an internet connection to become an investor in
an early-stage. While we build more usecases for the $buidl token, the demand will
increas thus increasing the store of value for every holder.
